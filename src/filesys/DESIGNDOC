		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES

// Block of all zeros which is used to write 0s to a file block

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode

It is exactly 8 MB. I have used double indirection to achieve this.
The first level sector table is stored in the inode->data.start block. Since size required to store each block sector is 4 Bytes and the size of each block is 512 bytes, I can store 128 entries in each disk block.
Each of these entries point to another disk block which acts like the second level disk block table.
Entries in the second level disk block table correspond to the actual disk blocks where the data is stored. The number of entries possible in the second level disk block table is again 128.
Hence, I have a first level disk block table present at inode->data.start. This indexes to 128 second level disk block tables. Each of these 128 second level disk block tables point to the disk blocks where the data is stored.
The total size becomes 512*128*128 = 8 MB


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

I have a lock on each inode present in the system. This will help synchronize all the per-inode operations.
A file is extended only when you are writing to it past the EOF or if you are seeking if past the EOF.
Both of these operations occur only after acquiring a lock on the inode corresponding to that file. Two processes can attempt to extend the file only if they execute these operations concurrently.
Even when that happens, the operations are synchronized which will make sure that only one of these processes can actually extend the file while the other process has to wait for it to complete.

If A tries to read the file before B writes to the file, then during this time the file is not extended. At this point if A tries to read from the EOF, since the semantics say that reading past the EOF should always return 0 bytes, I return 0 bytes. This is done by looking at the length of the inode before performing a read operation on a inode. If the read is passing the EOF, I return 0. By this A reads nothing of what B will write.
If B writes to a file before A performs a read, then write at a position past EOF will result in the file being extended. This will make sure that the length of the inode is updated and the disk blocks are allocated, if required, and then the new data is written into it. If A performs a read after this, then A will read all of what B has written.
If A tries to read the file while B is writing to it, the block which A is trying to read will be in the buffer cache. The writes being performed by B are on the memory which represents the file block in the buffer cache. Now both of the processes have the same buffer block. Now A can read only that data that is written by B. This means that A will be able to read part of what B has written.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
